CSSURE is web api, server and backend, what we call a kinderæg.

When using this project you should change the IP-address in launchSetting.json in the properties folder to your IP-address.

Its the applicationUrl in line 17 that contains the IP-addresses that should be changed. 

First make sure the Client (ASSURE) and server (CSSURE) is connected to the same hotspot.

To find the IP-address of the hotspot:
- Open "Kommandoprompt"
- Type "ipconfig"
- Find the IPv4 Address under "Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi"
